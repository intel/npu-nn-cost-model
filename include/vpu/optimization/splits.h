 * Pass halo to intra tile splits. Especially edge tiles are influenced by halo. Important are what NN uses and 2nd the
 * memory aspects
 * Input halo influences NN up to v2.7. To be ported if positive to edge tiles.
 * Output halo + cnt influences NN v4.0 and onwards. To be ported to edge tiles (+ inner tiles if larger than edge tile)
 * output_inbound halo is not used by NN, only for memory, if left unchanged increases memory but the layer was already
 * checked to fit in memory.
